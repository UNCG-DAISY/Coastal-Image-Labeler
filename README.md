### It's a labeling tool!

![Labeler](https://github.com/UNCG-DAISY/Coastal-Image-Labeler/blob/master/docs/static/img/labeler.gif)

Labeled images are important for supervised machine learning. The Coastal Image Labeler is focused on easily accommodating multiple users labeling the same images to ensure 
consensus for (potential ambiguous) discipline-specific labels. This tool allows us to crowdsource the development of a labeled image dataset that is relevant for coastal 
scientists.

The labeler is deployed here: [https://coastalimagelabeler.science/](https://coastalimagelabeler.science/). You can log on and start labeling post Hurricane images collected by [NOAA NGS](https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/).

You can check out the Coastal Image Labeler documentation for more info:

A data release of labeled [Hurricane Florence images is already available](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11604192.v1). You can merge these labels with post-storm 
images, which can be downloaded from [NOAA NGS](https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/) or using [this nifty python command line downloading tool](https://github.com/UNCG-DAISY/psi-collect). We are using these labeled images to [detect washover](https://github.com/UNCG-DAISY/WashoverML).
