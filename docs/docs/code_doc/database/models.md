A major change in the v3 Dashboard is the structure of the database. More models where added to help with performance and creating queries.

## Terminaology 

I will draw comparisions from MongoDB to SQL terms. Starting from the bottom,

- `Row` in SQL is called a `Document` in MongoDB.
  - For example we have a Document for image `P25959661.jpg`

- `Table` in SQL is called a `Collection` in MongoDB.
  - For example we have a Collection for all images

- `Schema` in SQL is a `Namespace` in MongoDB.
  - For example we have a Namespace called `dev` or one called `production`.

## Models

The following are the TypeScript interfaces for each model. If a key has a `?` next to it means its optional.

### Catalog

The Catalog object is the overarching model that contains the archives which in
turn contains the images. It also contains the questions that are applied to all
images of archives that are part of this catalog. This is the types of the
Catalog.

```js title="Catalog model"
export interface CatalogDocument extends Document {
  dateAdded?: Date
  name: string
  path: {
    original: string
    compressed?: string
    //This is here so that any path can be added, for example like gradcam or aux paths
    [id: string]: string
  }
  catalogInfo?: CatalogInfo
  taggable: boolean
  questionSet: ObjectID | string
  imageServeOrder?: {
    type?: 'random' | 'sequential'
    data?: any
  }
  totalImages?: number

  updateImageCount(): Promise<void> //Function to update totalImages
}
```

There is a new noteable field called `imageServeOrder` that defines how to serve imags. By
default it is "random" however if the json file used for import via the CLI is like so
```js
{
    "path":{
        "original":"xxx",
        "compressed":"xxx",
        "gradcam": "XXX",
        "aux": "XXX"
    },
    "name":"xxx",
    "taggable":true,
    "catalogInfo":{
        "year": 2020,
        "link":"xxx",
        "description":"xxx"
    }, 
    "imageFormat":[".jpg",".jpeg"],
    "questionSet":"xxx",
    //This part right here
    "imageServeOrder":{
        "type":"sequential",
        "data": {
            //archive name
            "archive1":["image1.jpg","image2.jpg","image3.jpg","image4.jpg"]
        }
    }
},
```

Then images of `archive1` will be assigned in that order (image1 is assigned first, then image2 then image3 and so on). **NOTE** 

:::caution 
If there are other archives such
as `archive2` that isnt defined then that archive will use random assignment.
:::

#### Archives

These are subfolders of the Catalogs and is originally in place due to how the
NOAA images where downloaded. They serve no other purpose other then to group
images up and serve as a link between Catalogs and Images

```js title="Archive model"
export interface ArchiveDocument extends Document {
  dateAdded?: Date
  name: string
  path: {
    original: string
    compressed?: string
  }
  catalog: ObjectID
  taggable: boolean
  totalImages?: number

  updateImageCount(): Promise<void> //function to update totalImages
}
```

### Images

The Image models most important fields are the `tags`, the `tillComplete` and
`taggable` fields. A major change is the `tillComplete`,`finalTag`,`finishedTagging`,and `tags` fields have been removed

```js title="Image model"
export interface ImageDocument extends Document {
  archive: ObjectID
  dateAdded?: Date
  name: string
  path: {
    original: string
    compressed?: string
  }
  taggable: boolean
}
```

### Question Set

Of the current models, the question set is the only one that is **NOT** checked.
It serves simply as a guideline for admins to use. Due to this nature it is
**HIGHLY** reccomended to make sure the documents for Question Sets are correct
and is best to copy an existing one

```js title="Question Set model"

export interface QuestionSetDocument extends Document {
  name: string
  description: string
  questions: any[] | QuestionSetQuestions[]
}
```

These are some Typescript type annotations to help understand the structre of each question type. Anything with `?:` means its optional, else its required

There are 4 types of questions, Radio,Checkbox,Quick submit button and Textfield.
```ts 
type QuestionSetQuestions = TextFieldQuestion | ButtonSubmitQuestion | CheckboxQuestion | RadioQuestion

type RadioQuestion = {
  type: "radioGroup",
  required: boolean,
  label: string,
  docLink: string,
  key: string,
  errorMessage: string,

  //This means array of json objects, with each object having a name and value
  buttons: {
    name: string,
    value: string
  }[]
}

type CheckboxQuestion = {
  type: "checkboxGroup",
  required: boolean,
  label: string,
  docLink: string,
  key: string,
  errorMessage: string,

  min?: number,
  max?: number

  buttons: {
    name: string,
    value: string
  }[]
}


type ButtonSubmitQuestion = {
  type: "buttomSubmit",
  required: boolean,
  label: string,
  docLink: string,
  key: string,
  buttons: {
    label: string,
    tag: any,
    key: string
  }[]
}

type TextFieldQuestion = {
  type: 'textField'
  required: boolean
  label: string
  docLink: string
  key: string
  multiline: boolean
  rows: number
}
```

### User

Finally there is the user model which is more or less the same

```js title="User model"
export interface UserDocument extends Document {
  username: string
  catalogs: [ObjectID]
  dateAdded: Date
  roles: string[]
  userId: string
}
```


### Assigned Image

This is one of the newer models. It serves to store the currerntly assigned image of a (user,archive) pair. This model requires that `imageId`,`archiveId`,`userId` be given. The remaining fields are automatically created

```js title="Assigned Image model"
export interface AssingedImageDocument extends Document {
  imageId: ObjectID
  catalogId?: ObjectID
  archiveId?: ObjectID
  userId: ObjectID
  date: Date
  archive?: ArchiveDocument
  catalog?: CatalogDocument
}
```

### Tag

Another new model. This model takes the data from the `tags` field of an image and places each tag as a new entry. This is done for many reasons. Firsty it makes it easy to get a list of images that have been tagged, since every entry is a tag of an image that has been tagged. It also ensures that certain pieces of information are recorded such as `userId` and `imageId`

```js title="Tag model"
export interface TagDocument extends Document {
  imageId: ObjectID
  catalogId?: ObjectID
  archiveId?: ObjectID
  userId: ObjectID
  tags?: any
  date: Date
  ignoreFields?: string[]
  image?: ImageDocument
}
```

## Namespaces

As mentioned before Namespaces are like Schemas in SQL. Generally there are 3, a
dev namespace,a production namespace and test namespace.
