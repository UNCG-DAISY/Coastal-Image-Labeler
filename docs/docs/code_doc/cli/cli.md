The CLI is called `cil-import`. It is found at `src/cli`. Before using the CLI it is recommended to always build it to ensure the latest version is being used.

## Build CLI

1. Go to `src/cli`
2. `npm install`
3. run `sudo npm run link` to create the CLI.
4. Check with `cil-import -V` that the version is the same as `package.json`
