### Impact Types

:::info
**Require**: False

Choices 
- Swash
- Collision
- Overwash
- Inundation
:::

Do your best to estimate the Sallenger Impact Regime experienced by the land in the image. For reference: 

![Goslin and Clemmensen Figure3](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jerome_Goslin2/publication/319954890/figure/fig3/AS:568850036662272@1512635825824/Schematic-illustrations-of-barrier-systems-under-the-four-storminess-regimes-of-Sallenger.png)

### Terrain Types

:::info
**Require**: True  
**Select atleast atleast 1**

Choices 
- Sandy Coastline
- Marsh
- Inland
- River
:::

The river environment is likely the most confusing, but many psot storm images extend inland to rivers. You might not see many exampels in these data because we have worked hard to prune these (as we are focusing on impacts to sandy coastlines).

## Radio Questions

### Damage Type

:::info
**Require**: True  
Choices
- No visible damage to structures/infrastructure
- Visible damage to structures/infrastructure
:::

Do you see damage to buildings? or building roofs? Sometimes siding or debris suggests that buildings in the scene were damaged

### Washover Type

:::info
**Require**: True  
Choices
- No visible washover
- Visible washover
:::

Do you see washover deposits that you think were active during the past storm event? You will likely need to zoom in and inspect the image closely. Often beach access points or spaces between homes allow for overwash and washover deposits to form. 

### Development Type

:::info
**Require**: True  
Choices
- Undeveloped
- Developed
:::

For this work, even single paved road or parking lot suggests the land has been developed in some way by humans.
