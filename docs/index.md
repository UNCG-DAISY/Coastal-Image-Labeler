# Coastal Image Labeler

## Goals

  + The Coastal Image Labeler (CILabel) is designed to collaboratively label
  coastal images and then provide these labeled images as open data (FAIR) for
  general community use.

  + **Why labeling images?**
      - Labeled images are important for supervised machine learning research. There are
      many well known labeled image databases (e.g., [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org)),
      but these existing databases tend to focus on general features (e.g., cats, dogs, horses, etc.). Our goal with this project is to develop a discipline-specific
      database of labeled images that is relevant for coastal scientists.

  + **Why not use an existing tool for labeling?**  
      - Many good labeling tools already exist, but our goal with this project is to
      create a tool for *collaboratively* labeling coastal images. Additionally,
      we wanted a tool to easily accommodate multiple users labeling a single
      images (to ensure correct labeling via consensus).

  + The Coastal Image Labeler Documentation is focused on:
      - Describing the goals of the project and our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
      - Documenting the underlying source code for the labeling tool — see the [Code Documentation](code_documentation/overview.md) section.
      - Documenting how to interact with the labeling tool as a User — see the [User Documentation](user_documentation/overview.md) section.
