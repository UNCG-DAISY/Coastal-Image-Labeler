This is an explanation for each package used and `npm` scripts that are in `package.json`.

This is the contents of the `package.json` file that can be found at `src/server/package.json`

## Overview of packages

I will be providing a short few sentences of each package. Most are important
for maintaining the dashboard, but some are not noteworthy and are used to
assist other packages.

### @material-ui/core

This is the UI component library used for the overall style of the website. The
website for the package is [here](https://material-ui.com/). It follows the
material UI principles laid out by Google.

### @material-ui/icons

From the same place as [the above](#material-uicore) but for icons.

### axios

Used for api calls, but this package might soon be removed as it is redundant.
It remains until all instants of it are removed.

### clsx

Package used to create unique classNames for components. It is used in select
few areas.

### colors

This package is used to print colored text in the command line.

### dotenv

This package allows for the use of `.env` files which contain environment
variables such as database passwords, which ports the host server is on,
or if the server is in development or production mode.

### express

This is one of the most critical packages. It is a web framework for node.js
that simplifies code alot. It's great, so much so I will link it [here](https://expressjs.com/).

### express-fileupload

Related to the express package [above](#express). Allows for uploading of files
from user to server.

### express-session

Again, related to express package [here](#express). Handles session management and tokens.

### ip

Package that gets the IP of the server so that we can create the API calls
dynamically rather then hard coding the servers IP.

### isomorphic-fetch

Allows for the use of the browsers `fetch` command on serverside. This is called
when a server side rendered page needs to make some sort of call, such as
getting user details or getting storms, before it sends the page to the user.

### moment

A time formatting library.

### moment-timezon

Related to the moment package [(above)](#moment), this helps with timezone conversion.

### mongoose

Adds object modeling for MongoDB documents. MongoDB is a noSql database so
there isn't any structure to entries (anything can be added to anything).
Mongoose adds some structure to those entries such as making sure certain
fields exists or only have certain data types. Found [here](https://mongoosejs.com/)

### morgan

Allows for logging of api requests and responses. While not used its helpful for debugging.

### next

A reactJs framework that allows for server side rendered pages. Found [here](https://nextjs.org/)

### node-geocoder

Allows for geocoding. Currently not used but might, eventually.

### passport

Authentication package. Found [here](http://www.passportjs.org/).

### passport-auth0

Related to the [above](#passport) when using the Auth0 method of signin, which can be found [here](https://auth0.com/).

### prop-types

Not important to talk about, just a subpackage.

### react

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, very important, found [here](https://reactjs.org/)

### react-dom

Related to the above package [here](#react)

### react-momen

Related to the above package [here](#react)

### slugify

Slugifies strings, used for formatting various strings.

### uid-safe

Security package.
